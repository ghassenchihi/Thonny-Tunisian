                <h1>About Tunisian Thonny Development Pack</h1>
                <p>Welcome to the official home of the Tunisian Thonny Development Pack. We are a dedicated team of educational technology enthusiasts and software engineers focused on bridging the gap between global programming tools and local educational
                    requirements in Tunisia. Our mission is to democratize computer science education by providing accessible, localized, and pre-configured software tools that meet the specific standards of the Tunisian national curriculum.</p>

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>The core philosophy behind the Tunisian Thonny Pack is simple yet ambitious: no student should struggle with their tools just because they speak a different language or follow a specific syllabus. Standard Integrated Development Environments
                    (IDEs) like Thonny are incredible tools, but they are often built with a generic, English-speaking audience in mind. This creates a barrier to entry for young students in Tunisian schools who are just beginning their journey in Python
                    programming.
                </p>
                <p>By distributing a localized version of Thonny, we remove the language barrier. We ensure that the interface, error messages, and documentation are accessible. Furthermore, we understand that the Tunisian curriculum places a heavy emphasis
                    on Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt. Standard Thonny installations do not always come with these libraries pre-installed or configured, leading to frustration in classrooms. Our pack solves this
                    by bundling the necessary Qt5 libraries and plugins, ensuring that the tools work "out of the box."</p>

                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                <p>This project is maintained by a group of volunteers comprising former computer science teachers, open-source contributors, and students from top engineering schools in Tunisia. We witnessed firsthand the difficulties teachers face in computer
                    labs—spending more time fixing installation errors than teaching code. We created this pack to give teachers their time back and to give students a seamless learning experience.</p>
                <p>We are not a corporate entity; we are a community-driven initiative. We collaborate closely with inspectors from the Ministry of Education to ensure that our software aligns with the latest pedagogical guidelines. Our background in software
                    development allows us to maintain the code, ensure virus-free distribution, and update the package as new versions of Python and Thonny are released.</p>

                <h2>Why the Tunisian Version?</h2>
                <p>Why do we need a specific version for Tunisia? While Python is a universal language, the context in which it is taught varies. The Tunisian "Thonny Tunisia" version includes:</p>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li><strong>Arabic Localization:</strong> Full support for Arabic characters in the interface, making the tool less intimidating for beginners.</li>
                    <li><strong>Curriculum Alignment:</strong> Pre-installed libraries and snippets specifically mentioned in Tunisian textbooks (4th year secondary, etc.).</li>
                    <li><strong>Bundled Dependencies:</strong> Includes Qt5 and other essential frameworks so students don't need to struggle with pip commands or internet connectivity issues during class.</li>
                    <li><strong>Optimization:</strong> Tweaked to run smoothly on the often older hardware found in public school computer labs.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We are proud to contribute to the technological advancement of the next generation of Tunisian developers. By providing a robust, localized tool, we hope to inspire innovation and creativity across the country.</p>
